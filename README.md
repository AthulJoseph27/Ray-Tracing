## Getting Started

### Executing program

* Clone this repo.
* Run `javac -d ./temp Main.java` to compile the code.
* Navigate into the temp folder using `cd temp` and run `java Main` to execute the program.

* Alternatively, you could run `javac -d . Main.java` followed by `java Main` , but this would fill your package folders with compiled files, the above one is much cleaner.
If you are using and editor like VS-Code, you could just hit the run button on top and no .class files would be created - clean and easy.
